# Frequently Asked Quesions
In no particular order, a list of the most commonly asked questions, followed by the simplest possible answer:

- Who?
  - Who is this for?  _Anyone with an interest in soil health_
  - Who is behind it? _Walt Ludwick for Quinta Vale da Lama, in partnership with GROW Observatory and FCUL (Faculty of Sciences, Lisbon University)_
- Why?
  - Why bother? _Because global climate change is affecting our soils in such a way -desertification being the most clear and present risk to our natural resource base- that soil moisture is probably the most important ecological indicator we have to monitor_
  - Why not monitor using satellite data? _a useful, but not complete solution, as available data is too low-resolution/ high-latency to give us the nuanced and timely feedback we need. Putting that data together with this sensor data (i.e. "ground-truthing" of satellite data) gives the best possible picture; that is in fact the motivation behind EU funding of this project._
- What? _see project README.md for answers, including..._
  - What are the general aims?
  - What are the specific objectives? Metrics?
- How? _see project README.md_
  - How essentially does this work?
  - How do you avoid...?
- Where?
  - Where is it currently deployed? _Various sites in 11 countries around Europe, of which Quinta Vale da Lama has the largest deployment (175 sensors) as of this writing._
  - What is the intended scope of deployment? _375 sensors (including the 175 above) in West Algarve, another 500 or more in Alentejo... and 15k around Europe, by the end of the project._
- When?
  - When did it begin?  _early 2017_
  - What is the term of the project? _committed funding from EU runs out in autumn of 2019_
  - Are there any deadlines, or scheduled progress milestones? _we aim to get all sensors in Portugal deployed by end of 2018 -for sure before end of Q1 2019._
